There is no Front Panel associated with this VI. The VI 43 Config File Get Input Scales starts by receiving a configuration file path from the VI 40 Config File path. The configuration data line is opened, but no file is created. The values for voltages A-D and currents A-D are read from the sections Voltage Scales or Current Scales. For each key (such as Va, Vb, Ia, Ib…) the value associated with the key is recorded to the respective global variable. If no key is found, a 1 is returned. All errors are sent through the process as error in/error out. Once complete, the mapping reference is closed and no files are written, indicated by the False constant.
