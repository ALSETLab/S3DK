This component creates a waveform from a 1D array of numerical controllers and a 1D array of timestamps. The component can also interpolate the data if the timestamp array size is the same size as the data array and the interpolated boolean is True. Interpolating the graph does not affect the earliest and last readings, the interpolation creates samples in between the two end points in relation to the timestamps.
