The component takes an array of boolean indicators and an index indicating a column. The output array will be a copy of the input array however the initial column will be the column indicated by the cut index and will follow order from that column. The output array is just a rearranged version of the input array but the first column corresponds to the cut index, the order of the output array follows the original from the index onward. The columns that were before the indicated column are placed after the last column and resume original order.
